# Steps to run YCbCr on KITTI dataset
1. Download the KITTI dataset from here.
2. Download shadow removal algorithm on YCbCr color space from [here](https://github.com/mmostipan/shadow-removal/blob/master/Shadow%20Detection%20and%20Removal%20Based%20on%20YCbCr%20Color%20Space.pdf)
3. Change the path of dataset or_img to the path of KITTI dataset.
4. Change numbers related to the shadow and lit areas if it is needed.
